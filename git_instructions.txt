Clonning repos and pushing changes

8. Now the fun part. clone this: git@github.com:techwithq27/Configs.git (may have been done at the start of this, if so move on to next step)

9. Where ever you clone the repo, cd into it

IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT EVER FORGET THIS PART, OTHER WISE YOU CAN ERASE/MESS UP SOMEONES PROJECT, do this enough and NO ONE will allow you make PR's from your git hub account, not that hard to get banned if you're messing with peoples work.

10. Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps the main branch clean and allows for better collaboration: git checkout -b $CHANGE_THIS_NAME

11. Verify you are on the new branch: git branch

13. Make changes to some file, this one is fine. Save the changes.

14. Stage the changes: git add . 

15. Commit your changes: git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"

16. git push -u origin $NAME_YOU_PICKED_ON_STEP_10

Key Differences Between Pushing Updates and Making a Pull Request

    Pushing Updates:
        You update a branch directly, typically in a repository you own.
        No additional review process unless configured.

    Making a Pull Request:
        You propose changes to another branch or repository.
        Maintainers or collaborators review and decide whether to merge the changes.
        Often used for contributing to open-source projects or team
